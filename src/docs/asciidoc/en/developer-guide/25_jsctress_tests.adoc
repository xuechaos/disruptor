> The Java Concurrency Stress (jcstress) is the experimental harness and a suite of tests to aid the research in the correctness of concurrency support in the JVM, class libraries, and hardware.

The Disruptor has some jcstress tests to experiment and validate the correctness of the concurrency promises that the
Disruptor makes.
