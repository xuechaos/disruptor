== Git Hooks

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI which runs the gradle build task to check the project can be built on each
commit/pull request.

So that you don't push changes that will fail the simple `test` & `check` steps we would suggest adding the git pre-commit
hook which will block any commit you try to do locally if the code fails these steps.

The git hook can be set up using the following gradle task:

[source,shell script]
----
$ ./gradlew setUpGitHooks
----

== Signed Commits

> Git is cryptographically secure, but it’s not foolproof. If you’re taking work from others on the internet and want to verify that commits are actually from a trusted source, Git has a few ways to sign and verify work using GPG.
